# Tweet & Eat

A tool that predicts the chances that a person will eat at a restaurant with a specific price category (cheap, moderate, expensive, very expensive) based on their tweets. The tool was built using **natural language processing (NLP)** on tweets using **+650** Twitter users and **+23M** tweets data.


## Some intentersting facts that were found using **Mutal Information** studies for **feature selections**:

The frequency of _air travel_ terms in tweets is a major indicator of whether the person is a more than average vistor to cheap resturnats with a high probability.

On the other hand, the frequency of of _affection_ terms in tweets indicate whether the person is a more than average vistor to very expensive resturants! 


## Installation

The project consists of the following files:

* Data Files
* Data Cleaning & Linguistic Analysis 
* Labeling (obtaining the visiting frequency for each price category)
* Analysis of Users' Time of Availability on Twitter
* Feature Selection & Prediction Models

As of this point, only the _Feature Selection & Prediction Models_ file is shared in this repository. To view the file online click [here](https://github.com/Engmhabdalla/Tweet-Eat/blob/master/regression%20and%20classification%20models.ipynb).
