# Tweet & Eat

A tool that predicts the chances that a person will eat at a restaurant with a specific price category (cheap, moderate, expensive, very expensive) based on his tweets. The tool was built using natural language processing on tweets using +650 Twitter users and +23M tweets data.

## Installation

The project consists of the following files:

* Data Files
* Data Cleaning & Linguistic Analysis 
* Labeling (obtaining the visiting frequency for each price category)
* Analysis of Users' Time of Availability on Twitter
* Feature Selection & Prediction Models

As of this point, only the _Feature Selection & Prediction Models_ file is shared in this repository. To view the file online click [here](https://github.com/Engmhabdalla/Tweet-Eat/blob/master/regression%20and%20classification%20models.ipynb).
